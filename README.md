# vanillaToDo

Project "to do list" - designed to create a list of tasks. The program helps to manage to-do lists, implement planned tasks and not forget anything. The user has the ability to create a list of tasks, in the process of their execution, can change delete, complete, sort, search by name.

## Task list functionality:
### Adding a task 
To add a task of the day, you need to click on the input fields (Enter the task...), enter your text, confirm our input with the add button.

### Task changes 
After clicking on the [ Add to ] button, the task gets into the Daily tasks: where we can continue to contact it, we have access to change the text in the task, if we need to delete the task, click on the trash can on the right, in order to mark the task as completed, we mark checkmark it on the left.

### Filtering tasks 
To display specific records, we use the filter buttons [ all ], [ completed ], [ in completed]. Thanks to them, our Daily tasks will change according to the condition on which button we clicked the output of all records, completed and not completed.
